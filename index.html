  <h1> What is a sunset? </h1>
  <p> A sunset is the moment when the sun appears to disappear below the horizon, as a result of the Earth's rotation.</p>
  <h2>Common Questions</h2>
  <dl> 
    <dt>Why is it colorful?</dt>
    <dd>When the sun is low in the sky, sunlight has to travel through a thicker part of the atmosphere, which scatters blue light more strongly. <div>This leaves more red and yellow light to be seen, which is why sunsets are often red or orange.</div></dd>
    <dt>When does it happen?</dt>
    <dd>They usually happen every 24 hours, but the specific time each day varies throughout the year due to Earth's orbit around the sun.</dd>
