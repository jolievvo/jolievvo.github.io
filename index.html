  <h1> How are sunsets formed? </h1>
  <p> When the sun is low on the horizon, the rays of sunlight pass through more air in the atmosphere than they do when the sun is higher in the sky, resulting in more scattering light.<div>This creates the colorful sunsets that we see everyday (some days more colorful than others).</div></p>
